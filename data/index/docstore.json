        "text": "**About NYC Housing connect** NYC Housing Connect is your portal to find and apply for affordable housing opportunities in New York City. What is affordable housing? - Housing is considered affordable if it costs about one-third or less of what the people living there get in income. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and Housing Development Corporation (HDC) create affordable housing opportunities for many household income levels and sizes. The buildings are privately owned. HPD and HDC have a monitoring and oversight role. There are rental and homeownership opportunities. Rentals are regulated so the rent can't go up too much over time. Condos, coops, and 1-4 family homes have restricted prices.\n\nHow does Housing Connect work? - Through Housing Connect, you can find and apply for affordable rental and homeownership opportunities. To qualify, your household must meet the income and size requirements for a unit in the affordable development. Your household is all of the people who will live in the affordable unit.\n\nThere are two ways to access opportunities in Housing Connect. It is a good idea to do both: Apply to developments with open lotteries. - These are new and recently renovated buildings.\n\nClick \"yes\" that you wish to be considered for re-rentals/resale's. This question is in \"Re-rentals and Resale's\" section. - These are individual affordable units that become available when someone moves out.\n\n- (Link:- <https://youtu.be/i5vdppVH5qQ>)\n\n**Thinking about applying? Here's how to prepare:** You can improve your application with a few important steps. But these steps can take time -- get started today! Know your credit and rental history - If you apply for an affordable rental, and are reached for an eligibility review, you may be asked to undergo a credit check. You can also choose to provide proof of positive rental history instead of a credit check. To prepare for a credit check, make sure the information in your credit report is correct. You can get help understanding your credit report and learn how to improve it from a free, professional financial counselor. Go to nyc.gov/ready-to-rent for more information, or call 311 and ask for \"Ready to Rent.\"",

Check the details to see if your household size and income fit the limits for the buildings.\n\n- Click \"Apply\" before the application deadline date.\n\n- It is very important to update your profile information immediately any time your household members or their incomes change. This can be before or after you apply to any specific development.\n\n> Need help? Not sure if you qualify? Visit our HPD Housing Ambassador page for help. You also call 311 and ask for a Housing Ambassador near you. After the deadline: - Each application gets a random number---a lottery log number. Lottery log numbers are random. No one controls who has a better or worse number.It does not matter if you applied first or last, online or on paper---your log number is random. Just make sure to apply before the deadline.\n\n- The Marketing Agent reviews the applications, beginning with set-asides and preferences.In new buildings, 5% of units are for households where someone has a mobility disability, and 2% for vision, or hearing disabilities. Usually, this is called a \"disability set-aside.\"Sometimes preference for a percentage of units is given to other categories of applicants. These preferences will be listed on the development's advertisement. Visit the FAQ for more details.\n\nAfter you apply: - It can take several months or longer to hear about your application. Sometimes you might not hear back even if you qualify. While you're waiting, carefully check what your current lease says about moving out before the lease is over. If you're offered an apartment, you might need to move quickly. If you aren't selected or don't hear back, keep searching for other apartments and apply when you are ready.\n\n> Be ready in case you are contacted for documents - If your application is selected, you'll be invited to respond to a document request. This interview is very important. Agents from the building will confirm if you qualify for the opportunity you applied for. Get ready ahead of time to make sure you're prepared.",

Keep updating your Housing Connect information and working on getting ready in case you're selected for another building! **Ready to Apply** > The first step in applying to affordable housing is to create a Housing Connect profile. You will need information about the incomes of everyone who will live with you. Calculate your income - Income includes money you make from a regular job, owning your own business, and/or part-time work. It also includes other money you get from workers' compensation, the government (like Social Security or public assistance), and certain payments from investments and retirement.\n\n- Most of this information will be on the tax return you filed last year. If you work for someone else, include the amount you are paid before taxes (called your \"gross income\"). If you work for yourself, including the amount you make after taxes and other deductions (called \"net income\").\n\n- If you need more help understanding what counts as income, check out HPD's income guide for affordable housing applicants.\n\nSearch Housing - Use the Open Lotteries page to find current affordable housing opportunities. You can filter opportunities by household size, household income, minimum and maximum monthly rent, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, transportation options, and amenities offered.\n\n- Every listing will show you how many homes are available, how many people can live in each home, the income range your household must fall in to qualify, and when the application is due.\n\n- Remember: keep your Housing Connect profile up to date. For example, if you get a new job or lose a job, make sure to update it. Check your profile every time you apply for a new opportunity.\n\nApply - If you find a building that you qualify for, click the \"Apply Now!\" button.\n\n- Apply before the deadline! The application period can last from a few weeks to a couple of months, so leave yourself enough time.\n\n- As long as you apply before the deadline, it doesn't matter when you submit your application.\n\n- Don't send both paper and online applications; you may be disqualified.\n\n- For help filling out an application, contact a Housing Ambassador.",

You may be charged a non-refundable credit/background check fee.\n\n**Do I have to provide my SSN (Social Security Number) or ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number)?** - You are not required to provide your Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number in order to submit an application for an affordable housing lottery. You may leave the question blank. Do NOT enter a fake SSN (like \\\"000-00-0000\\\"), because that can slow down application processing.\n\n- If your application is reached and you qualify, you will be asked to undergo a credit check or demonstrate rental history. If you undergo a credit check, you will need to provide an SSN or ITIN.\n\n- Alternatively, you can provide proof of good rental history, which does not require you to provide an SSN or ITIN. In this case, the only forms of personal identification you need to provide are described in the \"request for documents\" section above (including IDNYC cards, drivers' licenses, and non-driver state ID cards).\n\n**Can I use my IDNYC card to apply for affordable housing?** - Yes, if your application is reached and you qualify, you can provide your IDNYC card as an acceptable form of personal ID. To learn more, read the FAQ sections on requested documentation and Social Security / Individual Taxpayer Numbers.\n\n**What should I expect after I apply for an affordable housing opportunity?** - Visit the About page to learn about the application process and the steps involved. You can also visit the Housing Connect Application Guides section of HPD\\'s website for more information and resources.\n\n**Once I submit my application, can I make a change?** - Yes. It is very important that you update your household and income information in NYC Housing Connect every time there is a change. The changes will show up on any of your applications where your lottery log number has not yet been reached.\n\n- Important: If your household summary is flagged as incomplete, your application may not be selected for processing or issued a log number.\n\n**Once I submit my application, can I withdraw it?** Yes.",

To withdraw an application, log in to NYC Housing Connect. Go to your dashboard, and click on the development. At the bottom of the window, you will see the option to withdraw your application. This action cannot be undone. **What do I need to provide if I get a request for documents?** - The request for documents includes all required items to submit. This documentation is necessary to support the household information from your application and confirm that you qualify. These documents generally include but are not limited to personal IDs, pay stubs, tax returns, proof of address, and asset documentation.\n\n- Acceptable forms of personal ID include drivers' licenses, non-driver state ID cards, and IDNYC cards. Birth certificates or other forms of documentation like a school letter may be necessary for children under 18.\n\n- Make sure to include ALL requested documents in one submission, when you respond to the document request. After submitting your response, the option to submit more documents disappears until after the developer has reviewed.\n\n**I applied to a lottery but didn\\'t get a log number. What happened?** - Within a few weeks after the lottery application deadline, Housing Connect randomly assigns log numbers to all applicants whose applicant profiles (Household Info) are complete.\n\n- If your Household Info becomes incomplete after you apply but before log numbers are assigned, you will not receive a log number for that lottery. This could happen if you are in the process of making updates to your profile and have not completed them. It could also happen if someone in the household turns 18 but does not have any income or assets.\n\n- Please make sure your Household Info is complete and up to date at all times.\n\n**How do I know if I have been rejected?** - You can see the status of your applications on your Dashboard.\n\n- When your application is reached in a specific lottery, your Dashboard will show its status as ineligible if your household information (size and income) do not meet the development\\'s requirements.\n\n- If you respond to a request for documents to confirm that you qualify, but the marketing agent\\'s review determines that your household does not meet the guidelines, you will receive a rejection notice.",

The federal government, HPD, and HDC set minimum and maximum requirements. You may also be disqualified if the household submitted more than one application per household for the development.\n\n**How do I appeal?** - If you receive and respond to a request for documents, the marketing agent for that development then conducts a review to confirm that you are eligible. If the review finds that you do not meet the requirements for the development, you will receive a rejection notice. This notice will come to your email and appear on your NYC Housing Connect dashboard. The notice will explain why you were rejected.\n\n- If you believe that you were rejected from a lottery in error, follow the instructions in the rejection notice. Act quickly. The notice will tell you how many days you have to submit an appeal. You will submit your appeal and supporting documentation through Housing Connect.\n\n- If your appeal to the marketing agent is not successful, you will receive an appeal rejection notice, with an explanation. This notice arrives via email and on your NYC Housing Connect dashboard. If you still believe you were wrongly rejected, follow the instructions in the notice to submit a complaint, with documentation, to either HPD or HDC. The instructions will provide the correct contact information for that lottery.\n\n**Why am I seeing an error message when I try to submit my appeal?** - Please try shortening the text you have included in \\\"Reason for Appeal\\\" textbox. You may include as many attachments as you\\'d like, but the appeal can only be submitted if the description in the \\\"Reason for Appeal\\\" textbox has fewer than 100 characters.\n\n**What is a Marketing Agent?** - Marketing Agents are people responsible for leasing or selling affordable housing. They work for the housing developer or owner. Sometimes the Marketing Agent is part of the developer's company. HPD and HDC monitor the leasing and sales processes.\n\n**What if I don\\'t want to apply online?** - If you don\\'t want to apply online, you have the option of submitting a paper application. You may have an application mailed to you.",

Vouchers and rental subsidies such as Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (HPD or NYCHA), City FHEPS, ISS, Medicaid Waiver, and VASH are all accepted. Minimum income requirements do not apply if you have a voucher or a rental subsidy. However, rent should be within maximum limits allowed by your voucher or rental assistance program.\n\n- This means that your household will not be disqualified for being under income if your household has a voucher that would cover your rent. This is true even if your household\\'s income is less than the eligible income you see on a lottery advertisement.\n\n- Please note that if your application is reached for a development, the marketing agent will contact you for proof of the subsidy and the amount of rent it covers. If you do not know the maximum rents covered by your rental assistance program, contact the agency that allocated your certificate or voucher.\n\n**What does \\\"paid by the City of New York\\\" mean?** - One of the profile questions is, \\\"Are you an employee of the City of New York? This means you are paid by the City of New York.\\\"\n\n- You should answer \\\"Yes\\\" to this question if you are a municipal employee and your paycheck comes from the City of New York. For example, you may work for the NYC Department of Education, FDNY, or the Human Resources Administration.\n\n- If you answer \\\"Yes\\\" to this question and your application comes up for processing, your employment with the City of New York will be verified as part of the eligibility review.\n\n**People with Disabilities** **What is a reasonable accommodation?** - Federal law prohibits discriminations against people with disabilities in housing. A reasonable accommodation is a change, adaptation, or modification to a policy, program, service, or workplace which will allow a qualified person with a disability to participate fully in a program. Examples of reasonable accommodations include the addition of a ramp to allow a wheelchair user to enter the building; allowing a service animal in a building that has a no pet policy.\n\n**What is a disability set-aside unit?",

        "text": "Examples of reasonable accommodations include the addition of a ramp to allow a wheelchair user to enter the building; allowing a service animal in a building that has a no pet policy.\n\n**What is a disability set-aside unit?** Many developments must create and designate specific affordable housing units for people with mobility, vision, and hearing disabilities. These are called \\\"disability set-aside units\\\" and they are designed according to the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). - A mobility set-aside unit means that the floor plan and certain features are designed to be accessible to someone with a mobility disability. Once a household is approved for a unit set aside for people with disabilities, they have an opportunity to let the building owner know of any additional and specific accommodations they need (i.e., removable under-counter cabinets, etc.).\n\n- Vision/hearing units are wired to support alarm systems to serve people with hearing and visual disabilities. Similarly, additional features may be requested as needed (i.e. talking or braille appliances, etc.), once an applicant is approved for a unit.\n\n**I have a disability, but it does not affect my mobility, vision, or hearing. Can I still apply?** - At this time, our disability set asides are reserved for people with mobility, visual and hearing disabilities, and tied to federal funding and compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Applicants who do not have a mobility, visual or hearing disability can still apply for affordable housing in the general affordable housing lottery and request reasonable accommodations from the owner if alterations to the unit are needed.\n\n**Do I Qualify?** **Do I have to go through a credit check?** Not necessarily. If the developer or marketing agent has confirmed that you qualify and there is a unit available, there is one more step: You can choose to (1) show that you have paid your full rent for the past 12 months or (2) have your credit reviewed. Option 1: Rent payment history. You will need to provide: - Proof of the amount you are supposed to pay in rent monthly, like your lease, a notarized affidavit from the building owner or manager, etc.\n\nAND - Proof that you have paid the full rent each month for the last 12 months.",

Can I apply through Housing Connect?** Yes, non-New York City residents can apply, however, preference is given to current New York City residents. New York City is defined as the five boroughs: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. What are the preferences? The City is committed to widening opportunities for affordable housing for all New Yorkers. Please note that all applicants, regardless of preference, must meet the income, employment, and other eligibility criteria set for each property for which they are applying. Preference is given to applicants that meet one or more of the following criteria: 1\\. Persons with Mobility, Hearing, and/or Vision Disabilities Federal disability statutes give preference to five percent (5%) of units for households applicants with a household member who has a mobility disability. Another two percent (2%) of units receive preference for households with a household member who has a hearing or vision disability. 2\\. Current Community Board Residents (CB) For developments financed by the City, current residents of the Community District or Community Board (CB) in which the property is located receive a preference for fifty percent (50%) of the units. The community preference was established to provide greater housing opportunities for long-time residents of New York City neighborhoods where HPD/HDC have made a significant investment in housing. This preference does not apply to developments that do not receive City financing, e.g., those that only receive a tax exemption. To learn which CB you live in, visit: NYC Community Boards 3\\. Municipal Employees The City recognizes that many New York City municipal employees are required to live within the five boroughs and can often find it very difficult to obtain affordable housing. The municipal employee preference makes five percent (5%) of the units in HPD- or HDC-financed developments available to current municipal employees. Down Payment Assistance for homeownership applicants is also available. HPD/HDC will also work with its partners to provide homeownership counseling and education to municipal employees interested in becoming homeowners. To qualify for the municipal employee preference, you must be paid by the City of New York. City employees will be screened to ensure that no conflict of interest exists. If you are unsure whether you may have a conflict of interest, check with your agency.",

If you are unsure whether you may have a conflict of interest, check with your agency. 4\\. Project-specific Preferences As part of the agreements set forth for a specific development, additional preferences may apply. Such preferences may include, but are not limited to, preferences for Seniors or Veterans. These preferences are listed in the advertisement for the development. **Can I apply my Section 8 voucher/certificate or other rental subsidy to affordable housing in NYC Housing Connect?** - Yes. Vouchers and rental subsidies such as Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (HPD or NYCHA), City FHEPS, ISS, Medicaid Waiver, and VASH are all accepted. Minimum income requirements do not apply if you have a voucher or a rental subsidy. However, rent should be within maximum limits allowed by your voucher or rental assistance program.\n\n**This means that your household will not be disqualified for being under income if your household has a voucher that would cover your rent.** This is true even if your household\\'s income is less than the eligible income you see on a lottery advertisement. Please note that if your application is reached for a development, the marketing agent will contact you for proof of the subsidy and the amount of rent it covers. If you do not know the maximum rents covered by your rental assistance program, contact the agency that allocated your certificate or voucher. **I have an Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV). How do I enter this in Housing Connect?** If you have an Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV): 1\\. Go to the Household section of your profile. 2\\. When you get to the question, \\\"Does anyone in your household receive rental assistance that will move with them to a new apartment?\\\" **Answer \\\"yes.\\\"** To the question about rental assistance type, **check the box for either \\\"Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher from HPD\\\" or \\\"Section 8 voucher from NYCHA.\\\"** Your answer depends on which agency administered your voucher. Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHVs) are Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8) funded through the American Rescue Plan and offered through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).",

If you miss a mandatory question, you will be prevented from moving forward. **Income Info** - After you complete your personal details, you will be asked for income details. You can record multiple income sources for each member, Select the source that matches your income type and begin the questionnaire to respond one question at a time.\n\n- A key part of recording income for each employer is the annual wages. You can indicate if you know your annual wages from your most recent tax filing. If you do, you will be required to submit the income based on the appropriate IRS Filing. If you do not have information from the tax filing, you can submit your estimated annual income.\n\n- Please note that the income questions are an important part of the eligibility process, so you should take your time to make sure you answer them correctly. If you have specific questions, please review the FAQ section for answers. You can also go back change or update the employment details as needed.\n\n**Asset Info** - Once you have recorded your income details, you can add additional income details or, when you're done, move on to recording assets. The questionnaire will walk you through the asset questions. Just like in income details, you can record multiple asset types for each household member. Examples of assets you can enter include checking accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, and investment accounts.\n\n- You can also record any real estate you own. Alternatively, you can indicate that you do not have any real estate and complete the questionnaire for this household member.\n\n- Please remember to repeat the personal, income and asset questionnaires for each member of the household to complete your profile.\n\n**Housing Choices** - Once you have the household details for each household member completed, you can indicate your housing choices. Housing Choices allows you to opt-into re-rental and re-sale housing opportunities, if you are interested. Housing choices will walk you through questions to record your criteria for re-rental/re-sale opportunities by neighborhood and unit types. Please note that your answers to these questions will determine what re-sale or re-rental opportunities you are considered for, so keep that in mind when determining how specific you want your answers to be.",
