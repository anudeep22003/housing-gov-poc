**About NYC Housing connect** NYC Housing Connect is your portal to find and apply for affordable housing opportunities in New York City. What is affordable housing? - Housing is considered affordable if it costs about one-third or less of what the people living there get in income. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and Housing Development Corporation (HDC) create affordable housing opportunities for many household income levels and sizes. The buildings are privately owned. HPD and HDC have a monitoring and oversight role. There are rental and homeownership opportunities. Rentals are regulated so the rent can't go up too much over time. Condos, coops, and 1-4 family homes have restricted prices.

How does Housing Connect work? - Through Housing Connect, you can find and apply for affordable rental and homeownership opportunities. To qualify, your household must meet the income and size requirements for a unit in the affordable development. Your household is all of the people who will live in the affordable unit.

There are two ways to access opportunities in Housing Connect. It is a good idea to do both: Apply to developments with open lotteries. - These are new and recently renovated buildings.

Click "yes" that you wish to be considered for re-rentals/resale's. This question is in "Re-rentals and Resale's" section. - These are individual affordable units that become available when someone moves out.

**Thinking about applying? Here's how to prepare:** You can improve your application with a few important steps. But these steps can take time -- get started today! Know your credit and rental history - If you apply for an affordable rental, and are reached for an eligibility review, you may be asked to undergo a credit check. You can also choose to provide proof of positive rental history instead of a credit check. To prepare for a credit check, make sure the information in your credit report is correct. You can get help understanding your credit report and learn how to improve it from a free, professional financial counselor. Go to nyc.gov/ready-to-rent for more information, or call 311 and ask for "Ready to Rent." You can also go to nyc.gov/consumers for more information, or call 311 and ask to make an appointment at an NYC Financial Empowerment Center. If you prefer to provide proof of 12 months\' positive rental history in place of the credit check, prepare by collecting information about your current apartment, such as your current lease and receipts for rent. Go to the "Do I qualify?" section of the FAQ for more details.

Remember: - You cannot be rejected from an affordable rental opportunity based solely on credit score (the number). If you undergo a credit check, you can only be disqualified for over \$5,000 debt in collections or if you filed for bankruptcy within the last 12 months.You cannot be rejected for negative rental history. If you choose to provide proof of positive rental history in place of a credit check, that information can only be used to help you qualify.

Start saving - You should save at least two months\' rent to cover the first month and security deposit. You might want to save even more to cover moving expenses. Start saving for your move by finding a savings account that earns interest with a bank or credit union.If you have an IDNYC card, you can use it to open an account at many banks and credit unions. Go to nyc.gov/idnycbanks to find out where.

You will need information about the incomes of everyone who will live with you.
